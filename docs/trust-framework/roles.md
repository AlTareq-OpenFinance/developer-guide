# AlTareq Trust Framework - Roles

The Trust Framework defines the rights and permissions granted to each organization and its applications within the Open Finance ecosystem.

Roles are initially assigned to organisations during their onboarding into the ecosystem depending on their licencing with the Central Bank of the UAE. These roles reflect the Technical Access Scopes that the organisationâ€™s applications can request and use within the Open Finance ecosystem.

When creating an application, include all relevant roles required for interaction with LFIs. This ensures successful registration and full functionality across the ecosystem.

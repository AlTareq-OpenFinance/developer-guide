# AlTareq Trust Framework - Onboarding

The onboarding process to the **AlTareq Trust Framework** works in tandem with the **licensing processes** defined by the **Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE).**

## When You Can Onboard

As a **Third-Party Provider (TPP)**, you may begin onboarding to the appropriate Trust Framework environment based on your licensing status:

- **Sandbox Environment:**  
  You may onboard to the [Sandbox Trust Framework](https://web.sandbox.directory.openfinance.ae/) once the CBUAE has **confirmed receipt** of your **licence application** and **business plan**.

- **Production Environment:**  
  You may onboard to the [Production Trust Framework](https://web.directory.openfinance.ae/) once the CBUAE has **approved your licence.**

## Primary Business Contact (PBC)

As part of your licence application, you must nominate a **Primary Business Contact (PBC)**.  
The PBC will act as your organizationâ€™s main point of contact with **Nebras** and the **CBUAE** during onboarding and ongoing operations.

Within the Trust Framework, the PBC will:

- Serve as **system administrator**
- Manage user access
- Appoint technical contacts
- Coordinate the signing and submission of required legal documentation


## Access & Registration

When your organization reaches the appropriate point in the licensing process, the **PBC** will receive an email granting access to the Trust Framework platform.

**Steps to register:**

1. Click the link in the email to open the registration page.
2. Use the **same email address** provided for onboarding access.
3. Follow the prompts to set up your account credentials.

Once registration is complete, your **organizationâ€™s Trust Framework entity** will also be created.


After the PBC account is set up, they can **add additional users** within the Trust Framework platform.

Some of the key **resources** available include:

- **Payment Initiation**: Initiate domestic single instant payments, future dated payments, variable and fixed recurring payments. 
- **Accounts and Balances**: Access accounts, real-time balances, beneficiaries and more
- **Transactions**: Generate comprehensive insight through historical transaction data 
- **Customer Identity**: Access assured and verified customer identity information
- **Insurance (future)**: Access insurance quotation and data across Home, Motor, Health, Travel, Renters, Life & Employment.
- **International Payments (future)**: Initiate secure and seamless cross-border payments



All data access is **consent-driven**, ensuring users are always in control. See a more detailed view of the [Open Finance Roadmap](https://openfinanceuae.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OF/pages/6259008/Roadmap)

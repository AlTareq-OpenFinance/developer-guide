# Confirmation of Payee - Version <Version />

Confirmation of Payee (CoP) allows TPPs to submit a payee’s (i.e., creditor’s) identification details to the Open Finance Platform (OFP) and receive a response indicating whether the provided account name matches the one held in the LFI’s records for the specified account number. This service is especially valuable when users are making a payment or authorizing ongoing payment consent, as it helps confirm that the account details belong to the intended recipient—whether an individual or a business.
